  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      To start the axclick menu bar app:
        open #{opt_prefix}/axclick.app

      To find it in your Applications folder and Spotlight:
        ln -sf #{opt_prefix}/axclick.app ~/Applications/axclick.app

      On first launch axclick asks for Accessibility access. Homebrew builds are
      signed ad hoc, so after each `brew upgrade axclick` turn axclick off and on
      again in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.
